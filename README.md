# Game I made yea
This is kinda pointless but I think its neat
The Map is formed via perlin noise(I didnt write that part)
Arrow keys are for movement the Time gun follows your mouse
Hit v to see the block menu and Hit C to cycle blocks
click to place a block some do nothing, some slow you down and some are solid.
There where zombies but there unfinished
