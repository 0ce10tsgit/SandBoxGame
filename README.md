# Game I made yea
so this just takes the text file and turns it to terrain and some of the blocks have properties like water slows u down and u cant walk through solids
hold v key to see if ur in build mode, red hammer in the right cube that pops up mean if u click a tile it will be desrtroyed or if its a green pick then it wil place a block
that is visible in the cube to its left were u click. ITs tap space to switch between build and destroy and tap b to cycle blocks.
